This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of the paper *"MmWave Radar Perception Learning using Pervasive Visual-Inertial Supervision"*, which is a radar perception learning framework guided by a pervasive visual-inertial(VI) sensor suite, tracking  moving objects in the lack of 3D observations.

## Overview

![Overview](images/overview.jpg)

VIMP consists of two designs. First,we propose a recursive sensor fusion method that recursively uses the IMU measurements to compensate for the temporal drift of VIO. Second, we propose a feature-selection cross-modal learning framework. It first selects background visual features to supervise the radar’s point cloud reliably.
